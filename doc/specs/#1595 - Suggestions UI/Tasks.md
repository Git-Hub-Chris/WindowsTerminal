## Abstract

The command line is a highly powerful tool. However, its power is dependent on
the user's knowledge of the specific commands, flags and parameters needed to
perform tasks from the command-line. For simple everyday commands, this might not
be so hard. For longer commands, or ones used less frequently, there's quite a
bit of mental overhead trying to recall the exact syntax. For teams, it might be
helpful to share these tasks with everyone on the project. The Terminal can be a
aveneue by which complicated tasks can be remembered, shared, discovered and
recalled by the user simply thinking **"what do I want to do"**, rather than
"how do I do it".

## Background


> **Note**:
>
> This largely builds off of work in the [Suggestions UI], for displaying these
> tasks to the user. Make sure to read that spec first.

### Inspiration

The primordial version of this idea was probably [#keep] - a command-line tool I
wrote for stashing long command-lines and directories, and recalling them with
just a number. We've had many variations on this idea over the years - [#1595]
was probably the first such request on the Terminal repo. ITerm2 also had [a
similar feature](https://iterm2.com/images/CommandHistory.png). Theirs was more
directly tied to shell integration (that menu is populated from commands that
they know were run in the shell). In the absence of shell integration though, it
should be able to save these commands to a menu manually.

It is hard to say that the ultimate vision here isn't partially inspired by the
"[workflows]" of [Warp], or by [Fig]. These are modern tools that seek to
augment the command-line experience, by making the command-line more
approachable. Warp quite clearly has the same concept in "workflows" - scripts
which the user can build and Warp (a Terminal emulator) can insert quickly. Fig,
on the other hand, is more focused on just simplifing the command-line
experience. Fig is more about providing additional metadata to the user as
they're typing. They are [also working on workflows], so there's clearly quite a
bit of ecosystem-wide demand for more discoverable command-line tooling.

Consider also [VsCode Tasks]. These are files which can be placed in the root of
a workspace, and share common tasks between users of that workspace. They've got
support for starting processes, with a set of args. These args can also be
picked at runtime, and custom sets of arguments can be specified for individual
arguments.

We've had verbatim feedback that developers already attempt to record useful
commandlines in various different ways - in OneNotes, in shell scripts, in
aliases. Sharing these Providing a unified way to easily store, browse, and use
these command lines should be valuable to developers already doing this.
Furthermore, developers often share these commands with the rest of their teams.
A static file in their project containing commands for the whole team seems like
a simple solution to this problem.

### User Stories

Story |  Size | Description
--|-----------|--
A | üê£ Crawl  | Users can bring up a menu of command line tasks and quickly execute them
B | üê£ Crawl  | Fragment apps can provide tasks to a users settings
D | üö∂ Walk   | The user can save commands straight to their settings with a `wt` command
E | üö∂ Walk   | Users can have different tasks enabled for different profiles(/shells?)
F | üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run    | The terminal can automatically look for command fragments in the tree of the CWD
H | üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run    | Tasks are filterable by tool (`git`, `docker`, etc.)
I | üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run    | ? Tasks can both be atomic  _tasks_ and longer scripts. Tasks can be sent straightaway to the Terminal, while the longer scripts are more for reference (ex: [winget script]).
J | üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run    | Tasks can be filtered by text the user has already typed
K | üöÄ Sprint | Tasks can have promptable sections of input
L | üöÄ Sprint | Community tasks are hosted in a public GH repo
M | üöÄ Sprint | A simple UX (either web or in Terminal) is exposed for interacting with public GH repo of tasks

### Elevator Pitch

The Terminal can remember long command-lines and display them with user-friendly
descriptions of _what they actually do_. These tasks can be searched by intent,
rather than the particular combination of flags. They can be shared with members
of your team, so everyone has easy access to common tasks for a project.

### Why not just aliases / native script files?

Why not just take these tasks and put them into a shell alias? For longer tasks,
why not just stick them in a `.ps1`/`.bat`/`.sh`/etc file? This is an option
that's existed since the time immemorial. However, this still requires the user
to remember that they've created these aliases/scripts, remember where they're
stored, and remember how they work.

By providing a dedicated UI for these command-lines, they can always be at your
fingertips. No need to remember what the alias for a particular command-line is -
just look up what you want to do. Aliases and scripts are no longer scattered
across `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.profile`, etc, they can all be stashed in
the Terminal config, or in the project they're relevant to. By stashing them
alongside the code, then anyone else coming to work on the code can have
immediate access to useful sets of tasks.

Aliases have a tendency towards more experienced shell users. This proposal
instead brings the power of these aliases and scripts right to the foreground,
with a cross-shell mechanism of exposing them to even beginners. With fragment
extensions, tools can bundle common workflows together with their application so
the Terminal can automatically load them for the user.

### Community Tasks

_The big stretch version of this feature._

A community currated list of Tasks, for various tools. Stored publicly on a
GitHub repo (a la the winget-pkgs repo). Users can submit tasks with
descriptions of what the task does. The Terminal can plug into that repo
automatically and fetch the latest community commands, immediately giving the
user access to a wide bearth of common tasks.

## Business Justification

It will delight developers.

## Scenario Details

### UI/UX Design

For the most part, we'll be using the [Suggestions UI] to display tasks to the
user. This is a text cursor-relative UI surface that can quickly display actions
to the user, in the context of what they're working on.

The following are some examples from VsCode, Warp. These are meant to be
illustrative of what these menus already look like in the wild:

![](img/vscode-tasks-000.gif)

![](img/warp-workflows-000.gif)

The following gif was a prototype of [shell-driven autocompletion]. This was
more for suggestions from the shell, to the Terminal, but is helpful for
visualizing what this might look like in the Windows Terminal.

### Implementation Details

[TODO!]: # TODO! ---------------------------------------------------------------
What info do we all want for these tasks?

* The text to send to the terminal
  - This might be multiple lines of text, with newlines in it
* A friendly description of the command (different from the name?)
* Sections of the input that are promptable, s.t. the user can save the command
  as a "template", and fill it in at runtime
  - ex: `nuget push -apikey az -source TerminalDependencies ${path-to-nuget-package}`
  - how do we specify these as promptable sections without stomping on all sorts
    of other shells syntaxes?
* ~Maybe metadata about the command that it is used for? e.g. `git`, `docker`?~
  - This can probably be figured out from the first word of the command
* What shell it should be used for?
  - CMD, pwsh seem like clear choices.
  - linux shells are trickier - not sure Terminal can always figure out what
    shell is actually running once it boots up WSL. Is it `bash`? `zsh`? `fish`?
  - Running `ssh me@some-linux.box` from a CMD shell would instantly blow up
    shell-specific commands
  - a profile with a command-line of `cmd /k doTheThing & ssh you-get-it`, again,
    would blow up the heuristic matching
  - So maybe this is a **bad idea**. Maybe we should just leave tasks as "this
    is just a string of text for the commandline, you gotta know which shell to
    use it with"


#### Layering actions

* Fragments shouldn't be able to unbind actions from keys, _right_? TODO!
* How do we differentiate multiple actions with the same name, but different descriptions? I think everything is keyed off on Name at this point. Maybe it should be off some hash.

#### Settings comparison

##### Simple task

```pwsh
nuget push -apikey az -source TerminalDependencies ${path-to-nuget-package}
```

The JSON is pretty strightforward:

```jsonc
{
    "actions":
    [
        {
            "command":
            {
                "action": "sendInput",
                "input": "nuget push -apikey az -source TerminalDependencies ${path-to-nuget-package}"
            },
            "name": "Push to nuget feed",
            "description": "Used to upload a new dependency nuget to our internal nuget feed.",
        },
    ]
}
```

The trick here is the `${path-to-nuget-package}`. PowerShell accepts the
`${foo}` syntax to mean "a variable named `foo`". So us using that in our
settings syntax would require users to escape our parsing, if they wanted to use
that syntax in powershell.

##### Multiline script

For the [following script](https://gist.github.com/zadjii-msft/b598eebd6c5601328498e3e7acc581a7):

```pwsh
$s=Invoke-GitHubGraphQlApi "query{organization(login:`"Microsoft`"){projectV2(number: 159) { id } } }"

$tasks = get-githubissue  -Labels "Issue-Task" -state open
$bugs = get-githubissue  -Labels "Issue-Bug" -state open
$issues = $tasks + $bugs

$issues | ? {$_.labels.Name -notcontains "Needs-Triage" } | ? { $_.milestone.title -Ne "Icebox ‚ùÑ" } | ? type -Ne "PullRequest" | select -expand node_id | % {
  $resp = add-githubbetaprojectitem -projectnodeid $s.organization.projectV2.id -ContentNodeId $_ ;
}
```

The JSON is basically entirely unusable. Since JSON doesn't support multiline
strings, then every line has to be joined to a single line, seperated by `\r\n`.

```jsonc
{
    "actions":
    [
        {
            "command":
            {
                "action": "sendInput",
                "input": "$s=Invoke-GitHubGraphQlApi \"query{organization(login:`\"Microsoft`\"){projectV2(number: 159) { id } } }\"\r\n$tasks = get-githubissue  -Labels \"Issue-Task\" -state open\r\n$bugs = get-githubissue  -Labels \"Issue-Bug\" -state open\r\n$issues = $tasks + $bugs\r\n$issues | ? {$_.labels.Name -notcontains \"Needs-Triage\" } | ? { $_.milestone.title -Ne \"Icebox ‚ùÑ\" } | ? type -Ne \"PullRequest\" | select -expand node_id | % {\r\n  $resp = add-githubbetaprojectitem -projectnodeid $s.organization.projectV2.id -ContentNodeId $_ ;\r\n}"
            },
            "name": "Upload to project board",
            "description": "Sync all our issues and bugs that have been triaged and are actually on the backlog to the big-ol project",
            "shell": "pwsh",
        },
    ]
}
```

This version instead adds a `commands` parameter to `sendInput`, with the
implication that each of these should be sent with <kbd>enter</kbd> between
them.

```jsonc
{
    "actions":
    [
        {
            "command":
            {
                "action": "sendInput",
                "commands":
                [
                    "$s=Invoke-GitHubGraphQlApi \"query{organization(login:`\"Microsoft`\"){projectV2(number: 159) { id } } }\"",
                    "$tasks = get-githubissue  -Labels \"Issue-Task\" -state open",
                    "$bugs = get-githubissue  -Labels \"Issue-Bug\" -state open",
                    "$issues = $tasks + $bugs",
                    "$issues | ? {$_.labels.Name -notcontains \"Needs-Triage\" } | ? { $_.milestone.title -Ne \"Icebox ‚ùÑ\" } | ? type -Ne \"PullRequest\" | select -expand node_id | % {",
                    "  $resp = add-githubbetaprojectitem -projectnodeid $s.organization.projectV2.id -ContentNodeId $_ ;",
                    "}",
                    ""
                ]
            },
            "name": "Upload to project board",
            "description": "Sync all our issues and bugs that have been triaged and are actually on the backlog to the big-ol project",
            "shell": "pwsh",
        },
    ]
}
```

Still gross, but at least maintainable.

YAML or something else might make more sense here.

#### Per-project tasks(`.wt.json`?)

In addition to tasks stored in the user's `settings.json`, we also want to provide users with a way to store commands relative to their projects. These can be checked in to source control repositories alongside code. When the

[TODO!]: # TODO! ---------------------------------------------------------------
How do we want to represent this?
* snippets of JSON with `sendInput` actions is easy for the Terminal to understand.
* They are probably not that user friendly outside of Windows Terminal.
  Consider, users are gonna stick these JSON blobs in the root of their repo.
  Theoretically other tools should use them too. Is our json actions syntax what
  we'd really want to saddle people with?
* JSON is not super friendly to command-lines - since everything's gotta be
  encapsulated as a string, then you've got to escape characters (esp quotes
  `"`) for JSON strings
  - on the other hand, embedding tabs `\t`, newlines `\r`, escape characters, is fairly
    straightforward.
* Anything that's not JSON blobs will require a lot of spec'ing to come up with
  a standard, and more expensive implementation Terminal-side
  * For what it is worth, [Warp] uses .yaml files for their "workflows"[[1](#footnote-1)]. As an
    example, see
    [`clone_all_repos_in_org.yaml`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/workflows/blob/main/specs/git/clone_all_repos_in_org.yaml)
  * Yaml does have the neat benefit of not needing too much command-line escaping
* How do we want this to play with longer workflows? E.g. our familiar [winget script]
* Markdown [Notebooks] seems relevant here, but probably not best for annotating
  specific commands that we want the Terminal to pick up on. A
  `.terminal-tasks.md` seems simple enough to look for, but embedding metadata
  about which shell, what text should be prompted for, descriptions, that does
  seem harder.
##### File name

In my original prototype, I used `.wt.json` as the filename for a
filesystem-relative commands. This seems to me like a bit of a silly file name.
Node proejcts can store various aliases for commands in their `package.json`
file. Perhaps the `.` prefix isn't necessary. Would `wt.json` be too silly?

[TODO!]: # TODO! ---------------------------------------------------------------

##### Save to project on the commandline

As an example implementation, see [these
commits](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/compare/6f5b9fb...1cde67ac466e19394eea1eb3a41405513d160a6f).

`wt save --local commandline...`?
`wt save --settings commandline...`?
`wt save --file [path to file] commandline...`?

##### Shell escaping commandlines

Something like `wt save ping 8.8.8.8 > foo.txt` isn't going to work the way
users want. The shell is gonna get the first crack at parsing that commandline,
and is going to try and redirect the _output of `wt`_ to `foo.txt`.

<!-- This is something I encountered in #keep constantly -->

[TODO!]: # TODO! ---------------------------------------------------------------

Is there a better way to escape, like `wt save "ping 8.8.8.8 > foo.txt"` or something?

#### Community tasks from extensions

[TODO!]: # TODO! ---------------------------------------------------------------

Fragment extensions. Case in point: https://github.com/abduvik/just-enough-series/tree/master/courses/docker+docker-compose

## Implementation Plan

### üê£ Crawl
* [ ] The command palette needs to be able to display both the command name and a comment?
  - This will need to be reconciled with [#7039], which tracks displaying non-localized names in the command palette
* [ ] The command palette is refactored to allow it to interact as the Tasks panel
* [ ] [#1595] An action for opening the tasks panel, filled with all `sendInput` commands
* [ ] Fragments can add **actions** to a user's settings
* [ ] [#10436] Users can manage all their fragments extensions directly in the Settings UI

### üö∂ Walk
* [ ] The terminal can look for a settings file of tasks in a profile's `startingDirectory`
* [ ] [#5790] - profile specific actions
* [ ] [#12927]
* [ ] [#12857] Ability to save selected text as a `sendInput` action

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run
* [ ] When the user `cd`s to a directory (with shell integration enabled), the terminal can load the tasks from that directory tree
  - Kinda dependent on [#5790] and fragment **actions**, so we understand how they should be layered.
* [ ] Fork of [#12927] - promptable sections can accept a command to dynamically populate options

### üöÄ Sprint
* [ ]
* [ ]


## Conclusion

[comment]: # Of the above proposals, which should we decide on, and why?


### Future Considerations

[comment]: # Are there other future features planned that might affect the current design of this setting? The team can help with this section during the review.

This "tasks panel" is a part of a much bigger picture. We fully intend to reuse
this for the shell-driven autocompletions that xterm.js (read:VsCode) and
PowerShell are working on (vaguely tracked by [#3121]).

Longer workflows might be best exposed as [Notebooks].

## Resources

[comment]: # Be sure to add links to references, resources, footnotes, etc.


### Footnotes

<a name="footnote-1"><a>[1]: We may want to straight up just seemlessly support that syntax. The commands are all licensed under Apache 2.0. Converting them to WT-compatible json is fairly trivial:

```python
import yaml
import json

def parse_yaml_files(directory):
    json_data = {}
    json_data["name"] = f"{directory} tasks..."
    json_data["commands"] = []

    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith(".yaml") or filename.endswith(".yml"):
            file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                try:
                    yaml_data = yaml.safe_load(file)

                    command = {}
                    command["input"] = yaml_data["command"]
                    command["action"] ="sendInput"

                    new_obj["command"]=command
                    new_obj["name"] = yaml_data["name"]
                    new_obj["description"] = yaml_data["description"]
                    json_data["commands"].append(new_obj)
                except yaml.YAMLError as e:
